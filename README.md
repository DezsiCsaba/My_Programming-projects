# Programming-projects
- This reopsitory contains most of my **off school** programming projects(ongoing or finished)
- I usually do theese to have a peek into the working of particular algorithms and to take my mind away from school sometimes

- Most of the projects I embark on are inspired by the Coding Train youtube channel, or came to mind by doing some kind of university project:

    - [Coding Train Challanges repo](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges)
