- In this prject I attempted to bring the beauty of WFC to python using pgame and numpy for easy display and array usage
- I will deffinatelly try to use some more complicated methods to represent the connection possibilities between the different tiles so I can use some truely interesting tile images. 
  - Currently every tile knows 1 array containing numbers that represent the type of connections possible to every of it's sides.
  - But that can be further complicated by using sockets that represent different type of connection possibilities
  - Or we could see what RGB color code a side has and connect it that way, could also divide every side into multiple little sockets containing the colorcode
  - I will not go into detail of how my code could be imporoved, but if you are interested this is the [original C# implementation of WFC](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) by [mxgmn - Maxim Gumin](https://github.com/mxgmn). You can read about WFC in great detail here
